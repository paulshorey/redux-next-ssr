# Hello World

This is a new codebase. Very simple, yet very powerful! I'm excited about it.

### ❥ Redux

old fashioned, not @reduxjs/toolkit which is very awkwared to use with SSR

### ❥ SSR

1. fetch data from API
2. render it in SSR (instant)
3. dispatch it to Redux store, so client-side hydration will not lead to data discrepancies
4. this is done using server side functions, same ones used in client side!

### ❥ New standards

NextJS 13 /app directory, strict TypeScript 5.x, strict eslint, and other good stuff
